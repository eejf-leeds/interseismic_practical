However, it becomes challenging, particularly in areas lacking mapped faults or with complex arrays of active fault structures. In this method, all strains must occur along block boundaries, and every block must be fully enclosed by faults — even when some of these faults may not actually exist. \n",

A key advantage of this method is that it avoids the need to account for rigid block rotations, so tectonic blocks or microplates do not need to be defined. In addition to estimating fault slip rates, this approach can also resolve off-fault distributed moment sources that explain the observed diffuse deformation (Figure 6).
